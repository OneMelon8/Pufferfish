Our goal in this project is to create a reinforcement learning agent that can demonstrate basic strategies in player-versus-player combat such as knowing when to defend with a sheild, when to eat a golden apple to regenerate, and other interesting combinations of weapon swaps between an axe and a sword. Currently our RL Agent "Puffer" is trained against a hard-coded policy-based Agent "Fish" as a proof of concept/baseline to see whether our RL agent can learn.


**Below is our reinforcement learning agent (Agent "Puffer") who will be trained to fight against Agent "Fish"**
