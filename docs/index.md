Our goal in this project is to create a Reinforcement learning agent that can demonstrate basic strategies in  player-versus-player combat such as knowing when to defend with a sheild, when to eat a golden apple to regenerate, and other interesting combinations of weapon swaps between an axe and a sword. Currently our RL Agent Puffer is trained against a hard-coded policy-based Agent Fish as a proof of concept/baseline to see whether our RL agent can learn.

**Below is our reinforcement learning agent (Agent Puffer) who will be trained to fight against Agent Fish**
